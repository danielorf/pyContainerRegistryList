# pyContainerRegistryList

Simple python script used to list contents of a container registry compliant with Docker API v2.

It is currently designed to work with registries using bearer token auth or no auth.  Basic auth may follow later.

This library is currently intended only for Proof of Concept to understatnd the registry structure and auth.  Any implementation will probably find their way into more native (read: golang) languages/frameworks.
